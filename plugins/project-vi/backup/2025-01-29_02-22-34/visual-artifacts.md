# 5.3.1 Visual Artifacts (Diagrams & Models)

## Description

**Visual Artifacts (Diagrams & Models)** are a crucial category within [[technical-representation-and-documentation|Technical Representation & Documentation]] for the Node-Edge System. They encompass various forms of visual representation used to communicate, specify, and refine the system's design, structure, and functionality.

## Types of Visual Artifacts

- **Diagrams (2D Representations):**
    - **Mermaid Diagrams:** Text-based diagramming language used to create:
        - **Flowcharts:** Visualize processes, sequences, and system behavior (e.g., "Mechanism Flow Diagram").
        - **Entity-Relationship Diagrams:** Represent structural relationships and component interactions (e.g., "Edge Layer Interaction Diagram").
        - **Purpose:** Conceptual representation, functional visualization, high-level system architecture. Simple, code-based generation for easy iteration.

    - **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) Diagrams:** Vector-based 2D graphics for more detailed technical illustrations and drawings.
        - **Technical Drawings:** Dimensioned drawings, cross-sections, exploded views, and detailed component illustrations (e.g., "Detailed Spiral Mechanism Technical Drawing").
        - **Diagram Types:** "Edge System Visualization," "Spiral Mechanism Detail," etc.
        - **Purpose:** Precise visual representation, technical illustration, dimensioned specifications, detailed component views. Allows for high visual fidelity and technical accuracy.

- **3D Models:**
    - **STL (STereoLithography) Models:** Triangle mesh format for 3D geometric definitions.
        - **3D Component Models:** Geometric representation of individual components ([[edge-unit-10x10x100mm|Edge Unit]], [[spiral-mechanisms|spirals]], [[state-management|state managers]], [[node-unit-10x100x100mm|Nodes]]). (e.g., "Edge Basic Structure - STL Format," "Complete Edge STL Definition").
        - **Assembly Models:** Models representing assemblies of components and complete system configurations (e.g., "Complete System STL Definitions," "Complete Edge Assembly STL File").
        - **Purpose:** Precise 3D geometry definition, fabrication-ready models, CAD integration, physical prototyping (3D printing). Requires complete and accurate geometric data.

## Purpose of Visual Artifacts

- **Technical Communication:** Visually communicate complex technical information in an accessible and understandable way.
- **Design Specification:** Precisely define geometric properties, dimensions, and spatial relationships for components and assemblies.
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Aid in understanding abstract concepts and system behavior through intuitive visual representations.
- **Fabrication Enablement (STL):** Generate machine-readable files directly usable for 3D printing, CNC machining, and other digital fabrication processes.
- **Design Refinement Tool:** The process of creating visuals often reveals design flaws, ambiguities, and areas for improvement, driving iterative refinement.
