# Theoretical Framework Theme

## Overview
The theoretical framework establishes the mathematical and conceptual foundations of the system, defining relationships and principles that govern all aspects of functionality.

## Key Nodes
- [[geometric-principles]] - Fundamental mathematical relationships
- [[system-expansion-fractal-nature]] - Principles of scalability and pattern propagation
- [[technical-specifications]] - Detailed parameter relationships
- [[core-structure]] - Theoretical principles in physical form

## Theoretical Principles
- Dimensional relationships maintain consistent ratios
- Patterns self-replicate across scales
- Force and motion transfer follow predictable paths
- State changes preserve system harmony

## Implementation Impact
- Theory guides physical implementation
- Mathematical relationships ensure system integrity
- Theoretical framework enables predictable functionality
- Principles support system expansion
