# Connection Networks

## Physical Connections
Connection networks form the foundational framework that enables system-wide integration and functionality across all components.

### Interface Types
- [[edge-unit-10x10x100mm]] to [[node-unit-10x100x100mm]] connections
- Edge-to-edge transfer mechanisms
- Force distribution pathways following [[geometric-principles]]
- State coordination through [[state-management]]

## Motion Transfer Systems

### Mechanical Integration
- Integration with [[spiral-mechanisms]] for rotational systems
- Linear deployment through [[internal-mechanisms]]
- Force multiplication following [[technical-specifications]]
- Cross-edge coordination patterns

### State Control
- Synchronized movements managed by [[state-management]]
- Configuration control adhering to [[core-structure]] principles
- Transformation sequences documented in [[technical-representation-and-documentation]]

## System Implementation

### Network Architecture
- Follows [[system-expansion-fractal-nature]] for scalability
- Implements patterns from [[geometric-principles]]
- Documented in [[visual-artifacts]]

### Technical Integration
- Performance metrics detailed in [[technical-specifications]]
- Implementation guidelines in [[technical-representation-and-documentation]]
- Supports advanced configurations and transformations
