# 1.1.2.2 State Management

## Description

The **State Management System**, or **State Manager**, is a crucial [[internal-mechanisms|Internal Mechanism]] within the [[edge-unit-10x10x100mm|Edge Unit]]. Positioned at both ends of each Edge, State Managers act as control points, regulating the engagement, disengagement, and operational state of the Edge within the broader Node-Edge System. They are located within the [[core-structure|Outer Shell]] of the Edge Unit.

## Core Functionality

State Managers are fundamentally about **control**. They provide the ability to:

- **Engage and Disengage Mechanisms:** Control whether internal mechanisms (primarily [[spiral-mechanisms|Spirals]]) are active or inactive.
- **Control Force Transfer:** Regulate if and how forces are transferred between connected Edge Units or [[node-unit-10x100x100mm|Nodes]].
- **Manage System Configuration:** Set and maintain the operational state of the system, from a locked, rigid form to a dynamically transforming configuration.
- **Enable State Transitions:** Coordinate transitions between different operational states (locked, rotation enabled, force transfer, disengaged).

## Key Features and Modes

- **Location at Edge Termini (Ends):** State Managers are strategically positioned at both ends of each Edge, making them the interface points for controlling interactions with other components.
- **Connection-Based Activation:** State changes are conceptually triggered or controlled via connections at the Edge termini, implying a physical interaction at the connection interface.
- **Directional Control (90/45 degree transfer):** Functionality is specifically linked to controlling force/motion transfer to edges connected at angles, notably 90 and 45 degrees within a 3D axis system.

- **Operational States:** State Managers facilitate distinct operational states:
    1. **Locked State:** Prevents any rotation or motion transfer, securing the system in a fixed configuration.
    2. **Rotation Enabled State:** Allows [[spiral-mechanisms|Spiral Mechanisms]] to rotate and transfer motion between connected components.
    3. **Force Transfer Active State:** Enables specific mechanisms (like [[push-rod-systems|push rods]]) to engage and transfer force linearly through the Edge Unit.
    4. **Disengaged State:** Completely disengages internal mechanisms, allowing for free reconfiguration or disassembly of the system.

- **Locking Mechanism Integration:** State Managers incorporate a "cylindrical object" as a **lock**, physically preventing rotation and securing connections.

## Functional Role in System

- **Control Hub:** State Managers act as distributed control hubs throughout the Node-Edge System, giving localized control at each connection point.
- **Configuration Management:** They are essential for managing the overall configuration of the system, allowing it to switch between different forms and functionalities.
- **Dynamic Transformation Enablement:** By selectively engaging and disengaging mechanisms, State Managers orchestrate the complex transformation sequences of the Node-Edge System.
