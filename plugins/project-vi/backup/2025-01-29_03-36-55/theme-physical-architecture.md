# Physical Architecture Theme

## Overview
Physical architecture represents the tangible manifestation of Chain Theory principles, embodying dimensional relationships and system harmony through precise geometric forms and mechanical interactions.

## Key Nodes
- [[edge-unit-10x10x100mm]] - Primary structural element defining system scale and rhythm
- [[node-unit-10x100x100mm]] - Critical junction points enabling multi-dimensional interactions
- [[core-structure]] - Fundamental principles governing physical relationships
- [[box-construction]] - Complete system implementation demonstrating full-scale principles
- [[geometric-principles]] - Mathematical foundations of physical relationships

## Component Relationships
- Edge units connect to nodes following precise geometric progressions
- Core structure principles manifest in all physical components
- Box construction demonstrates complete system integration
- Physical architecture enables mechanical system implementation

## Implementation Considerations
- Dimensional accuracy critical for system functionality
- Component relationships follow Chain Theory principles
- Physical forms enable state transformation
- Structure supports mechanical system integration
