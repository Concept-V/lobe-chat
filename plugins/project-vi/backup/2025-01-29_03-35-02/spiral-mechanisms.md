# 1.1.2.1 Spiral Mechanisms

## Description

**Spiral Mechanisms** are a core functional element of the [[internal-mechanisms|Edge Unit's Internal Mechanisms]] and, by extension, the entire [[edge-unit-10x10x100mm|Node-Edge System]]. Inspired by the negative space of a drill bit, these spirals facilitate controlled rotation and motion transfer within the constraints of the Edge Unit's dimensions. They are housed within the [[core-structure|concentric rings]] of the Edge Unit.

## Core Concept - Solidified Negative Space

The fundamental concept for understanding these spirals is visualizing the "solidified negative space" of a drill bit. This mental model helps grasp their complex three-dimensional form and interlocking capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Primary Function - Rotation Transfer:** Spirals are designed to transfer rotational motion between interconnected components. When one spiral rotates, it drives the rotation of an interlocking spiral.
- **Variable Pitch Implementation:** The design incorporates variable pitch (variable "thread density") spirals, allowing for control over speed and force.
    - **Variable "Thread" Density:** In some sketches, varying "thread" density is visible, indicating deliberate variable pitch design.
    - **Speed and Vector Force Control:** Variable pitch enables influencing speed of rotation and vector force of motion transfer.

- **Interlocking Spirals:** Motion transfer occurs through the precise interlocking of spiral forms.
    - **Continuous Surface Interaction:** Unlike gears with discrete teeth, spiral mechanisms rely on continuous surface interaction for smoother, more versatile motion transfer.
    - **"Going Through" Each Other:** Interlocking spirals are conceptually designed to "go through" each other, enabling rotation transfer even when intersecting at angles.

- **Mathematically Defined Forms:** Spiral geometries are intended to be based on mathematically defined wave functions.
    - **Related Wave Functions:** Each spiral form follows "related wave functions" to ensure precise intersection and predictable motion transfer.
    - **Precise Interaction:** Mathematical definition is crucial for reliable interlocking and force transmission.


## Types of Spirals (Within Edge Unit)

- **Primary Spiral:** Located in the [[core-structure|Inner Ring]]. Function is primarily for [[push-rod-systems|linear actuation]] and initial rotational input.
- **Secondary Spiral:** Located in the [[core-structure|Outer Ring]]. Function is for [[connection-networks|cross-edge force transfer]] and interaction with [[node-unit-10x100x100mm|Nodes]] and [[state-management|State Management]] systems.

## Functional Role in System

- **Motion Backbone:** Spiral Mechanisms are the primary means of motion transfer in the Node-Edge System.
- **Transformation Engine:** They are essential for enabling the dynamic transformations of system configurations, such as deploying work surfaces, extending shelves, and reconfiguring shapes.
- **Versatile Force Control:** Variable pitch and spiral interactions allow for nuanced control over force and motion, enabling both delicate adjustments and robust actuation.
