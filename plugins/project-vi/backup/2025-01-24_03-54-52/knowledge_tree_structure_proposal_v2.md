## Notes on Knowledge Tree Usage:
1. Each branch contains both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation details
2. Cross-references between branches should be maintained for system coherence
3. Technical specifications should be updated as system evolves
4. User feedback should be incorporated into relevant branches
5. Documentation should maintain balance between technical depth and accessibility
