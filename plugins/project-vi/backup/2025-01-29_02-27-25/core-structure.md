# 1.1.1 Core Structure

## Description

The **Core Structure** of the [[edge-unit-10x10x100mm|Edge Unit]] defines its internal geometric organization. It is based on a system of layered concentric rings and precisely defined voids, all derived from fundamental [[geometric-principles|geometric relationships]]. This structure provides both physical organization and functional zones within the compact 10x10mm cross-section of the Edge Unit.

## Key Components

- **Central Void (2.5mm diameter):**
    - A hollow cylindrical space at the center of the Edge Unit.
    - Serves as a pathway for [[push-rod-systems|push rods]], wiring, or potentially cooling.
    - Reduces weight while maintaining structural integrity.

- **Layer 1 - Inner Ring (1mm thick):**
    - The innermost solid ring surrounding the central void.
    - Primarily houses the [[spiral-mechanisms|Primary Spiral Mechanism]].

- **Layer 2 - Outer Ring (1mm thick):**
    - Concentric ring surrounding the Inner Ring.
    - Houses the [[spiral-mechanisms|Secondary Spiral Mechanism]] and mechanisms related to force transfer and variable pitch implementation.

- **Layer 3 - Outer Shell (Approx. 3.5mm thick):**
    - The outermost layer forming the boundary of the Edge Unit.
    - Provides primary structural support and protection for internal mechanisms.
    - Integrates [[state-management|State Management]] components and lock points.

- **Trapezoidal Features:**
    - Conceptualized connection features arising from the geometric division of a square to an octagon.
    - Proposed as "male connection tabs" for [[connection-networks|node-edge interfaces]], though specific implementation details are still under development.

## Geometric Basis

The layered structure and dimensions are not arbitrary but are intentionally designed based on harmonious [[geometric-principles|geometric relationships]], including:

- Square-circle-octagon relationships
- Consistent radial zones
- Mathematical ratios to ensure dimensional harmony and functional integration.

## Functional Significance

The Core Structure provides:

- **Dedicated Zones:**  Clearly defined radial zones spatially organize different [[internal-mechanisms|internal mechanisms]] within the Edge Unit.
- **Structural Integrity:** The outer shell and concentric rings contribute to the overall strength and rigidity of the Edge Unit, despite its internal void and complex mechanisms.
- **Precision and Modularity:** The geometrically precise structure enables consistent manufacturing and predictable behavior across all Edge Units, crucial for the system's modularity and scalability.
