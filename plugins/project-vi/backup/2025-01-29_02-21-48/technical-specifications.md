# 5.3.2 Technical Specifications (Code & Formatted Text)

## Description

**Technical Specifications (Code & Formatted Text)**, alongside [[visual-artifacts|Visual Artifacts]], form the other primary category within [[technical-representation-and-documentation|Technical Representation & Documentation]] for the Node-Edge System. This category focuses on using code and structured text formats to achieve precise, machine-readable, and human-understandable technical specifications.

## Types of Technical Specifications

- **Code as Specification:** Programming code is used as a formal language to define technical aspects of the system:
    - **Python Code Examples:** Python snippets are used to programmatically define:
        - **Dimensional Parameters:** (e.g., layer thicknesses, diameters in `layers` dictionary).
        - **Mechanism Properties:** (e.g., spiral pitch ranges, thread depth, rotation ratios in `spiral_properties` dictionary).
        - **State Management Definitions:** (e.g., state positions, engagement parameters in `state_positions` dictionary).
        - **Functional Algorithms:** (e.g., functions for `calculate_variable_pitch`, `get_force_multiplication`, `get_rotation_transfer`).
        - **Purpose:** Executable specification, parameterized definitions, algorithmic representation of mechanisms and behavior, potential for simulation and automated design tools. While currently Python, other languages could be used.

- **Formatted Text Documentation (Markdown):** Markdown is used as the primary format for structured technical documentation:
    - **Comprehensive Documentation Artifacts:** Markdown is used to create "Complete Technical Documentation" that integrates:
        - **Textual Explanations:** Human-readable descriptions, specifications, and conceptual overviews.
        - **Embedded Diagrams:** Integration of [[visual-artifacts|Visual Artifacts]] (Mermaid and SVG diagrams embedded directly within Markdown).
        - **Embedded Code Snippets:** Inclusion of code examples (Python code blocks within Markdown).
        - **Structured Formatting:** Use of Markdown headings, lists, tables, and other formatting elements to create well-organized and easily navigable documentation.
        - **Purpose:** Human-readable documentation, integration of diverse representation types (text, diagrams, code), structured knowledge organization, format suitable for knowledge bases like Obsidian.

- **STL File Format (Code-Based 3D Model Specification):** While STL is technically a "model," its code-based (ASCII or binary) nature also makes it a form of technical specification.
    - **Machine-Readable Geometry:** STL code provides a precise, machine-readable definition of 3D geometry, essential for digital fabrication.
    - **Emphasis on Code Quality:** User feedback emphasizes the need for "complete, uninterrupted, and error-free" STL code, highlighting STL's role as a rigorous technical specification, not just a visual representation.

## Functional Role

- **Precise Definition:** Code and formatted text provide the means to define technical aspects of the Node-Edge System with a level of precision and detail that is difficult to achieve with purely visual or descriptive methods.
- **Machine Readability:** Code-based specifications (Python, STL) are machine-readable, enabling potential for automated design tools, simulations, and direct fabrication processes.
- **Human and Machine Understanding:** Markdown documentation bridges the gap between human-understandable descriptions and machine-readable code, creating a comprehensive and accessible technical knowledge base.
