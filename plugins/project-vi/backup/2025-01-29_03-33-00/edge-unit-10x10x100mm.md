# 1.1 Edge Unit (10x10x100mm)

## Description

The **Edge Unit** is a fundamental, standardized component of the Node-Edge System. Measuring a constant 10x10x100mm, it serves as both a structural element and a housing for internal mechanisms. While the 60x36x22cm Box is a key example configuration, the Edge Unit itself is designed for universal application across a potentially infinite variety of system configurations.

## Key Specifications

- **Dimensions:** 10mm x 10mm x 100mm
- **Constant Size:**  Edge dimensions are fixed across all system implementations, ensuring modularity and interoperability.
- **Housing for Mechanisms:**  Designed to contain a variety of [[internal-mechanisms|internal mechanisms]], including [[spiral-mechanisms|spirals]], [[state-management|state managers]], and push rods.
- **Geometric Basis:**  Dimensions and internal structure are derived from fundamental [[geometric-principles|geometric principles]], particularly relationships between squares, circles, and octagons.

## Role in the System

- **Building Block:** Edges are the primary linear building blocks of the Node-Edge System.
- **Motion Transfer:** Edges facilitate the transfer of [[spiral-mechanisms|rotational]] and [[push-rod-systems|linear]] motion throughout the system.
- **Structural Framework:** When combined with [[node-unit-10x100x100mm|Nodes]], Edges create the structural framework for various configurations, from simple boxes to complex workstations and beyond.

## Context and Usage

While the [[box-construction-60x36x22cm|Workstation Box]] provides a specific example, remember that the Edge Unit is a versatile component applicable to countless designs. Its fixed dimensions and internal capabilities are key to the system's scalability and fractal nature.
