This guide is intended to help all attendees—by way of our interactive Obsidian vault—navigate the adjusted workshop materials. Use this file as your roadmap.

## How to Navigate the Vault

- **Live Sync & Semantic Search:**  
  Our vault is live-synced via Project V. Use the built-in semantic search tool to quickly find relevant material by searching keywords such as "Tender," "Knowledge Base," "Workflow," or specific participant names (e.g., "Scott" or "Kelly-Ann"). This feature will help you locate insights and content across the Context and Attendee_Perspectives directories.

- **Directory Overview:**  
  - **Context:** Contains presentation slides, talking points, and notes for each section of the workshop.
  - **Attendee_Perspectives:** Contains tailored notes for each attendee (Neil, Ian, Kelly-Ann, Scott). These files summarise the unique considerations and interests of each role.
  - **Additional Files:** You may also find additional references (e.g., the Refined Outline Note) that consolidate our overall workshop strategy.

## Interactive Elements

- **Search for Insights:**  
  Try using the semantic search by typing in "AI Value," "Tender Responses," or similar phrases to see how the vault organises our critical concepts.

- **Review & Edit Exercises:**  
  As you review the files in the Context folder—especially the demo scripts and exercise instructions—feel free to add annotations or questions in the "Notes" files. This iterative process is part of our human-in-the-loop method.

- **Group Navigation:**  
  During interactive segments, you can use the vault's standard Obsidian linking features. For example, click on links within the "Attendee_Perspectives" to see idea cross-references, or jump directly to a related section in the "Context" folder. We encourage you to add your own connections and build a network of related ideas.

## Suggestions for Your Input

- Explore the "Attendee_Perspectives" files to refresh your memory of each participant's focus areas.  
- Use the "Interactive Navigation" guide to train yourself on how to use our live sync and semantic search tools to gather details on specific topics (e.g., reviewing tender response examples or security requirements).
- During breaks or group sessions, feel free to update any of the "Notes" files with new questions or insights so that we can refine our presentation in real time.

This interactive setup is designed to model exactly how Vi helps us generate, organise, and display information dynamically. If you have any questions or need further modifications, please let me know!

Happy refining,
Tim
