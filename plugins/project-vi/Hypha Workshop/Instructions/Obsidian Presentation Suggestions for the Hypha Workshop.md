Below are ideas on how to effectively incorporate Obsidian plugins and features into the Hypha Workshop presentation, aligned with relevant segments of your content:

## Using Slides Presentation Mode
- **Section 1:** 
  - Use the Slides plugin during this session to present a high-level overview of the AI landscape.
  - Great for introducing key concepts and market trends with bullet points and visuals.
  - Create a “transition” slide to summarise why generic AI solutions fall short.

## Leveraging Canvas for Visual Mapping
- **Section 3 (Open Discussion):**
  - Use Canvas if you’re brainstorming AI application ideas with participants.
  - It can illustrate the journey from generic AI concepts (Section 1) to tailored Vi Platform applications (Section 3), showing connection.

## Excalidraw for Live Diagrams
- **Section 2 (Vi Platform Capabilities):**
  - Sketch quick diagrams explaining workflows or data integration visually.
  - During interactive exercises (Section 2.3), illustrate how a typical Hypha-relevant process could be automated with Vi.

## Callouts and Rich Markdown
- **Throughout Presentation:**
  - Embed callouts to emphasise key takeaways or cautionary points.
  - Useful during Q&A segments in Section 1 and collaborative strategy session in Section 3.

## Templater for Consistency and Dynamic Content
- **Pre-Workshop Preparation:**
  - Prepare templates for consistent formatting in recurring presentation sections.
- **Interactive Exercises:**
  - Use prepared prompts or examples illustrating how business challenges are tackled using the Vi Platform.

## Dataview for Real-Time Data Display
- **Section 3 (AI Strategy Discussion):**
  - If collecting feedback or ranking AI use cases, use Dataview to display data dynamically on a dashboard slide.
  - This could be used as a visual snapshot of group responses or ideas during discussions.

Integrating these Obsidian features into your presentation will enhance interactivity and clarity precisely when needed. The strategic use of slides, diagrams, and interactive elements can significantly enrich participant engagement and learning outcomes.
