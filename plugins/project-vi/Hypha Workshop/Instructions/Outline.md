Use broadly relevant examples (e.g., document processing, task automation, data summarisation).
* **Tip:** *Keep demos focused and concise, highlighting 2-3 key functionalities effectively. Verbalise the *value* being demonstrated during each demo – "Notice how Vi *automates* this entire workflow, saving significant manual effort..." or "See how quickly Vi *summarises* this complex document, giving you instant insights..."*

**(2.3) Interactive Exploration - Hands-On with the Vi Platform (General) (Approx. 10 mins)**
* **Intent:** Allow participants to directly interact with the **Vi Platform (general version)**, reinforcing their understanding of its core functionalities and interface in a hands-on manner.
* **Activities:** Hands-on activity where participants interact with the **Vi Platform** (general access). Guided exploration with pre-set, generic prompts designed to showcase core platform functions they just saw demonstrated.
* **Tip:** *Clearly link the interactive exercise to the demonstrations they just witnessed. Encourage them to explore the functionalities they saw in action, reinforcing learning through doing.*

**(2.4) Debrief & Natural Transition to Hypha (Approx. 5 mins)**
* **Intent:** Briefly debrief the hands-on experience, gather initial reactions to the **Vi Platform's** capabilities, and create a smooth and natural transition into Section 3 - focusing on how these demonstrated platform capabilities can be applied to *Hypha's specific context*.
* **Activities:** Quick debrief of interactive session. Open floor for *platform-focused* questions. Strategic transition statement linking general platform capabilities to the coming Hypha-specific application discussion.
* **Tip:** *In your transition, ask leading questions that bridge the gap towards Hypha's needs: "Now that you've seen what the Vi Platform can do *in general*, imagine how these capabilities could be applied to *your own specific workflows and challenges at Hypha*..."  This naturally leads into the next section.*

**Section 3: Exploring AI Solutions for Hypha - Vi Platform Applications & Strategic Discussion (Approx. 50 mins + 10 min Break)**

**Strategic Intent:** To shift the focus entirely to Hypha's specific needs and challenges. To explore how AI, and specifically the Vi Platform, can offer practical solutions for Hypha. To foster a collaborative, educational discussion about Hypha's AI strategy and potential next steps – keeping the tone consultative and exploratory, not overtly sales-driven.

**Subsections:**

**(3.1) Vi Platform – Exploring Potential Applications for Hypha (Approx. 15 mins) - REVISED TONE**
* **Intent:** Shift the focus directly to Hypha. *Explore*, in an educational and consultative way, how the Vi Platform's capabilities *could potentially be applied* to address Hypha's specific pain points (tender responses, document management, etc.). Frame this as an *exploration of possibilities* rather than a hard sell. Use *simulated Hypha scenarios* to illustrate potential applications *without being overly forceful or promotional*.
* **Activities:** Explicitly reference Hypha's pain points again. Present *potential application scenarios* of the Vi Platform specifically relevant to Hypha’s context (using simulated Hypha data/examples). Frame this section as "exploring how AI *could* help Hypha," not "how Vi *will* solve all your problems."
* **Tip:** *Start with a statement that clearly indicates the shift in focus: "Now, let's turn our attention directly to Hypha. Based on what you’ve seen of the Vi Platform, let's explore *how these types of capabilities could potentially apply* to help Hypha address some of the key challenges you face." Maintain a tone of collaborative exploration and idea generation throughout this section.*

**(3.2) Interactive Exercise – Scenario-Based Problem Solving with Vi (Hypha-Relevant) (Approx. 25 mins) - REVISED FOCUS & TONE**
* **Intent:** Engage participants in scenario-based exercises that are *directly relevant to Hypha's work*, using the Vi Platform to explore potential AI-driven solutions for *simplified, representative Hypha challenges*. Keep the focus on hands-on *problem-solving and exploration*, not on pushing a specific product.
* **Activities:** Scenario-based interactive exercises using the Vi Platform. Scenarios should be simplified representations of Hypha challenges (tender-related tasks, document-related tasks, information retrieval scenarios). Provide prompts that encourage problem-solving using the Vi Platform.
* **Tip:** *Design these exercises to be genuinely helpful and insightful, even in a simplified format. Focus on facilitating learning and discovery – let participants *experience* the potential value of AI for themselves through hands-on problem-solving.*
