**Objective:**  
To integrate our session insights into the interactive Obsidian vault and ensure the remaining sections of the workshop address each attendee's needs.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Collect Specific Tech Insights:**  
   - Gather additional information on the technical components to be covered (e.g., security protocols, semantic search workings).
   - Confirm integration points within Vi for each key function (knowledge bases, agent configuration, workflow automation).

2. **Refine the Demo and Exercise Content:**  
   - Update demo scripts per our discussion, emphasising tender responses, document management, and meeting automation.
   - Prepare group and individual exercises with realistic, simplified Hypha scenarios.
   - Develop a backup plan for potential platform issues (e.g., knowledge base bugs or latency concerns).

3. **Update the Vault Accordingly:**  
   - Use the provided folder structure ("Context" & "Attendee_Perspectives") to create additional or updated content files.
   - Include summary notes and additional talking points for Sections 2 and 3 that:
     - Address the specific questions likely to arise (predicted or as recorded in the QAPrep file).
     - Outline each key value proposition (time-saving, security, integration, scalability).

4. **Predict Likely Questions & Draft Guiding Answers:**  
   - Based on participant profiles:
     - For Neil: Focus on challenges around scalability and integration.
     - For Ian: Emphasise practical workflow improvements.
     - For Kelly-Ann: Address security, compliance, and data privacy.
     - For Scott: Highlight architectural robustness and system interoperability.
   - Capture these questions in the "Section3_QAPrep_PredictedQuestions.md" file, and develop corresponding talking points that can be used during Q&A.

5. **Interactive Reminders:**  
   - Remind all participants to bring a laptop or device for interactive exercises.
   - Ensure example documentation and files are ready for upload during exercises.

6. **Plan Group vs. Individual Exercises:**  
   - Design interactive group tasks to build a shared knowledge pool and minimise individual inconsistencies.
   - Keep some exercises open-ended for individual input where it makes sense, but steer group discussions around common challenges.

**Your Role:**
- Review these plans, tweak them as per your creative insights, and integrate them into the live demonstration environment.
- Feel free to add or suggest additional visual aids when you see fit.

This plan is meant as a high-level guide to ensure the remainder of our workshop is as educational, interactive, and valuable as possible for every participant.

Let's move forward knowing we have a robust framework to build on!

Best,  
Tim
