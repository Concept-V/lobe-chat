- Boosted profitability by targeting the right customers with the right offers at the right time.
- Enhanced marketing ROI through **automated campaign optimisation**, saving costs on ineffective outreach.

**Example:** Australian wireless providers could send targeted 5G upgrade pitches to customers who frequently stream content or use high-bandwidth apps.


### **6. Infrastructure Deployment and Rollout**

**Application Opportunities:**
- **AI-Driven Site Selection:** Use AI analytics to identify optimal locations for new cell towers or small cells in urban and rural areas.
- **Cost Optimisation in Rollouts:** Automate logistics and deployment schedules for new wireless infrastructure builds.
- **Planning Smart Cities:** Collaborate with city councils to deploy wireless infrastructure in line with smart city goals (e.g., connected grid monitoring, autonomous public transit).

**Benefits:**
- Reduced deployment costs through optimised planning, saving **10-15% in annual CapEx** for wireless providers.
- Improved access in remote areas, bolstering Australia’s goals of universal broadband access.
- Faster rollouts of 5G, facilitating higher-speed and lower-latency wireless networks for businesses and consumers.

**Example:** AI could streamline Vodafone Australia's expansion of its 5G network, helping the provider focus resources on underserved rural areas in Tasmania or Western Australia.


### **7. IoT Integration Across Industries**

Australia's wireless communications networks will play a critical role in connecting IoT devices across diverse industries such as agriculture, mining, and healthcare.
