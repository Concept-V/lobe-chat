## **Experience at ConceptV**
Tim founded **ConceptV** in 2018 following a problem he observed in his parents' experience of building their first home. Despite having access to skilled professionals and advanced technology, their project faced cost blowouts, corrections, and unmet expectations. Recognising the broader issue, Tim discovered that ineffective communication during the design phase leads to 30% of all construction waste globally.

With this insight, ConceptV was launched to provide an easy, accessible, and agnostic solution to this problem.
