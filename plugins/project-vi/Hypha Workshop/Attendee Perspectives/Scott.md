# Scott Geldard â€“ Head of Program Delivery Perspective

**Overview:**  
Scott focuses on how AI can seamlessly integrate into Hypha's large-scale operations. With a strong technical background, he is looking for proof of scalability, robustness, and integration capabilities that ensure the smooth delivery of services.

**Key Understandings & Interests:**
- **Scalability & Robustness:** Interested in technical details about how Vi performs under high-demand, mission-critical scenarios.
- **Customisability & Extensibility:** Want to know how easily the platform can be adapted for Hypha's specific needs.
- **Strategic Operations:** Seeks an understanding of how Vi can be deployed across diverse teams reliably.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Looks for clear methods of how Vi will work with existing IT and communication systems.

**Suggested Focus in Upcoming Sections:**  
- In Section 2, demonstrate the underlying architecture and modular design of Vi.
- In Section 3, provoke discussion on program-level application and how the system can scale to meet Hypha's broader operations.
