# Endpoint Status Update

## Functional Endpoints
- post_read_resource: Working correctly
  - Successfully read "1_Introduction_to_Best_Vault.md"
  - Able to list resources in Best_Vault

- post_search_nodes: Partially functional
  - Returns empty results
  - Might require additional configuration or data population

## Non-Functional Endpoints
- get_entity: Not working
- get_relation: Not working

## Observations
1. Resource reading works with specific vault path
2. Node searching returns no results
3. Memory-related retrieval endpoints appear to be non-operational

**Recommendation:** 
- Investigate why get_entity and get_relation are failing
- Explore why search_nodes is not finding any entities
- Verify knowledge graph population and indexing
